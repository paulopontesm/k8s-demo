# K8s Demo

This project can be used as a reference to deploy a simple flask application using:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/)
- A [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/) "cluster" running in a [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) machine with [Microk8s](https://microk8s.io/#get-started) on [AWS EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/pt/ec2/)
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/)
- [Nginx Ingress Controller](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/)
- [Certmanager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/) + [Letâ€™s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) for TLS
- [GitHub Actions](.github/workflows/deploy.yml) for CI/CD

## Our application

For reference this repository uses the [Flask Minimal Application](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/quickstart/#a-minimal-application) that returns a simple "Hello world".

```bash
$ flask run
 * Environment: production
   WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
   Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Debug mode: off
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

Also, when starting the application we are warned by Flask to `Use a production WSGI server instead`. There are [many ways](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/deploying/) to deploy a flask app, but since our goal is to use it in a docker container, let's use one of the recommended [Standalone WSGI Containers](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/deploying/wsgi-standalone/), in our case [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/).

```bashq
$ gunicorn -w 4 --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 app:app
[2020-05-23 18:50:56 +0100] [14880] [INFO] Starting gunicorn 20.0.4

```

## Create a Docker Image

The definition for the Docker image can be found in the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile).

As a base image for our docker image we are using one of the [official docker images](https://hub.docker.com/_/python/) for python. For our application we use the tag `python:3.8-slim-buster`. The `3.8` stands for the python version, the `buster` stands for the [version of debian](https://www.debian.org/releases/buster/) that is used as the underlying image, and the `slim` stands for the [image variant](https://hub.docker.com/_/debian?tab=description) of debian which is more or less half the size as the "full fledged" debian image.

Other than that we just need to copy our `requirements.pip` and `app.py` to the workdir of our docker image and define the initial command to be executed when our image is ran.

```bash
$ docker run -it --name k8s-demo k8s-demo:latest
[2020-05-23 19:59:05 +0000] [6] [INFO] Starting gunicorn 20.0.4
